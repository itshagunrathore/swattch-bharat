        <h3>Extraordinary Ways You Can Go Solar and Save Energy  <i class="far fa-sun"></i></h3>

        <p>The usage of electricity is commensurate with the energy costs. It therefore means that the more you use electricity, the more you’ll have to pay for it. To make matters worse, we are in an age where almost all our essential tech devices need constant charge to function as desired. For this reason, electricity bills will continue to amount as long as we continue depending on our tech devices to carry out our day to day activities.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the sun offers a reliable and affordable alternative source of power. Because the sun freely exists and is inexhaustible, it can be harnessed and used to provide for our daily power needs. Hence, the question we need to ask is; how can one go solar and save on energy? Well, there are very many simple ways. </p>

        <div class="energy_cnt">
        <p>Some years back it seemed unconventional to have solar panels on top of one’s roof. Today, with technological advancements and the soaring prices of electricity, it’s the most rewarding thing you can do in your home. Having solar panels installed in your home can significantly help on saving on energy. If your area is a place that gets lots of sun throughout the year, then installing solar panels to produce electricity is a wise investment that will surely reduce your electricity bills.</p>

        <div class="energy_cnt">
        <p>The majority of people use huge amounts of energy on heating water. In a bid to cut on electricity or gas costs and save energy, you can go solar by heating your water using the sun’s free energy. Simply install a solar water heater. It works by circulating water through a black insulated collector to maximize absorption and retention of the sun’s energy to effectively heat the water.</p>

        <div class="energy_cnt">
        <p>The use of solar light bulbs for lighting can go a long way in reducing the need for artificial lighting, which consumes a great deal of electricity. Furthermore, solar light bulbs are durable and provide the same or even higher lighting efficiency as compared to the conventional light bulbs.</p>

        <p>Solar power banks and chargers directly utilize sun’s energy to power electronic devices. The advantage with them is that they are very portable. This means that even if you are traveling, you don’t have to worry about finding places with electricity to plug in your electrical devices to charge.</p>

        <p>By having a clothesline in your backyard or near the windows in your home and using it to dry your clothes, especially in summer, you’ll save on the energy that you would have used running the clothes in the dryer. What’s more, using the clothesline comes with an added advantage in that; you’ll save on cooling costs.</p>

        <p>There are various ways of making food last longer, which is also termed as food preservation. One of the longstanding techniques is drying or dehydration which was used as early as 12,000 BC. In as much as the modern techniques in existence today weren’t available then, people still successfully managed to preserve their food.</p>

        <p>Passive solar heating is one of the simplest methods of tapping solar energy because it doesn’t need any special technology. Provided your windows are facing the direction of the sun, that’s all you need to have your house heated and retain warmth during winter. By opening the curtains, it allows the windows to capture the warmth and radiate it into the house thereby providing free indoor heating.</p>
